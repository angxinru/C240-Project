# ShoreSquad

A playful, youth-focused beach cleanup web app concept.

## Tech Stack
- Static HTML5
- Modern CSS (no framework)
- Vanilla JavaScript

## Run Locally

Use VS Code with the Live Server extension:

1. Open this folder in VS Code.
2. Open `index.html`.
3. Start Live Server (Status Bar > "Go Live").

Then visit the URL shown (usually `http://127.0.0.1:5500/`).

## Next Steps
- Plug in a real map (e.g. Leaflet, Mapbox) instead of the placeholder.
- Integrate a real weather API for accurate cleanup windows.
- Add authentication or simple shareable links for inviting friends.
